FROM facts f 
LIMIT 10;

--INSTRUCTION 3 - Write a single query that returns the following
--1. Minimum population
--2. Maximum population
--3. Minimum populatin growth
--4. Maximum population growth

SELECT MIN(population),
	   MAX(population),
	   MIN(population_growth),
	   MAX(population_growth) 
FROM facts f;

--INSTRUCTION 4 - Write a query that returns the countries with the minimum population.
SELECT name
FROM facts f 
WHERE population IS 0;

--INSTRUCTION 5 - Write a query that returns the countries with the maximum population.
SELECT name
FROM facts f 
WHERE population IS 7256490011;

--INSTRUCTION 6 - Recompute the summary statistics you found earlier while excluding the row for the whole world. Include the following:
SELECT MIN(population),
	   MAX(population),
	   MIN(population_growth),
	   MAX(population_growth) 
FROM facts f
WHERE population > 0;

--INSTRUCTION 7 - In a different code cell, calculate the average value for the following columns:
-- popluation
--area

SELECT AVG(population),
	   AVG(area)
FROM facts f;

--INSTRUCTION 8 -  identify countries that have the following:

--Above-average values for population.
--Below-average values for area.

SELECT * 
FROM facts f 
WHERE population > (SELECT AVG(population)
						FROM facts)
AND area < (SELECT AVG(area)
				FROM facts)
